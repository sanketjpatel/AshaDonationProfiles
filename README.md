# AshaDonationProfiles
Wordpress plugin for Asha Donations.

This plugin allows to create a custom wordpress post, called Donation Profile.
Like a regular post a Asha chapter coordinator can add standard content - text, image, video to create
an engaging narrative. In addition to that, it accepts
* a target donation amount
* a channel id
* a project id
* a chapter id

Here is the end result that the user gets to see

This shows all the profiles which are actively raising funds for a cause with realtime tracking of how close to the target they are.

Currently, this plugin is being used for Chicago Bank of America Marathon.
However, it can be used for all donation campaigns.
